# Geofence

Geofence is Android app that will detect if the device is inside of a geofence area.

Geofence area is defined as a combination of some geographic point, radius, and specific Wifi network name. 
Device is considered to be inside of the geofence zone if itâ€™s connected to the specified network or remains 
geographically in the defined circle.

# Test assignment cover text

* As we discussed with "Dane McLeod" - no external non-android library is used in this project.
* This is just test assignment, not a production grade code. So i felt free to write some unstable,
unsupportable code, invent wheels, write something, i could never do in production. You can find
code those in package "com.denisroyz.geofence.di"
* Have to emphasize, this code was written after 9 hours working day on my current job. So i
am sure this can look pretty terrifyingly for a person with fresh mind. Unfortunately my mind
was exhausted during this code assignment implementation (you can check commits time to find
out when i had time to work on this).

# Project build process

I assume the ones who watch this doc already know how to build native android gradle projects with build variants.

Project have 2 flavours

### Mock 
* Contains implementation with mocked location manager, WifiManager. They provide always the same data:
1) Wifi network name: MOCK
2) GPS Lattitude: 50.440
3) GPS Longitude: 30.545
* This implementation holds "User entered rules" only during application life.
* This flavor is used for test purposes
 
### Production 
* Contains implementation, which uses android locationManager, WifiManager to get gps coordincates, 
wifi network name.
* This implentation saves "User entered rules".
* This is project flavor you want to look  into.

# Usage 

TBD
